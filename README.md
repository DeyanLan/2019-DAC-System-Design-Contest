# 2019 DAC System Design Contest
# Overview
The 2019 System Design Contest features embedded system implementation of neural network based object detection for drones. Contestants will receive training dataset provided by our industry sponsor DJI, and a hidden dataset will be used to evaluate the performance of the designs in terms of accuracy and power. Contestants will compete in two different categories: FPGA and GPU, and grand cash awards will be given to the top three teams in each category. In addition, our industry sponsor Xilinx and Nvidia will provide a limited number of teams successfully registered with a free design kit (on a first-come-first-served basis). The award ceremony will be held at 2018 IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference. The contest detail can be found at [DAC webpage](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/2019-DAC-SDC/index.html "悬停显示").

# DATASET
The contest dataset is provided from DJI, captured by unmanned aerial vehicles(UAV).
This dataset contains12  classes  of  images  and  95  sub-categories.  For  each  sub-category,  70%  of  the  images  are  provided  for  training  and30%  are  reserved  for  evaluation.
in  this  dataset,  most  of  the  images  have a object size __1-2%__ of the captured images (640x360), which is a main character of UAV-view images(ILSVRC with average object ratio 17%, PASCAL VOC with average object ratio 20%,). 

The 70% dataset is open source and can be download [here](https://pitt.box.com/s/756141768nn92cj0dkfbg6dan17c4h4q "悬停显示").
